![MY FLAG OF PUERTO FLAG](/images/download (1).png/)

I faced a problem when I forgot to put a comma and I had the color red without the comma. 
Place image wasnt working correctly for me but then I forgot to put a variable then the equal sign in order for it to work.
The work is getting harder by the day but im still keeping up with the class and thats a good thing but i should study more so i wont fall behind cause do not want to fail this semester.
