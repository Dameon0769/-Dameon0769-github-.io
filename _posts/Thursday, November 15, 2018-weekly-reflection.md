WEEK 8

During week 8 we learned designing functions with examples. During this lesson we had talked about cake and how certain parts of the cake represented something such as the flavor of the cake. During that we defined what parts of the cake had certain types of data we can use and parts of them were flavor being categorical string, layers being number, is-icecream being the boolean of the code.This is an example of the code:include image


data CakeType:
  | cake(
      flavor      :: String,
      layers      :: Number,
      is-iceCream :: Boolean)
end. 
This code is showing that the cake has different parts and what the parts mean as a data type




WEEK 9

During this week we was talking about table's and how the tables have Strings,Numbers,and booleans involved in it. Also talked about the types of data and usage of data. We also came up with questions we had and then later on we had to determine whether or not the questions were analysis or not. There is a code for the tables that tell us the specific traits that each animal we have and whats different or simliar to each other based on the information we get from the table. "animals-table = load-table: name, species, gender, age, fixed, legs, pounds, weeks
  source: shelter-sheet.sheet-by-name("pets", true)
end" This code tell us that their are different species,genders,ages,fixed animals,legs,pounds,and weeks old
