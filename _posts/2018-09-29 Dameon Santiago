I picked the question number 2 because I found it interesting that people from version 1 had a lower percentage than the people that took version 2 which both have the same answers. This question covered MS1 and was qualified as a Novice level question which is easy for lots of people to get right and get the credit for but for some reason people didnt tend to get this answer correct on version 1. For version 1 16.7% of people chose to pick answer b which was circle, this question was asking about the outermost function in the function given so people got confused and probobly picked circle since its right outside the perenttheses for solid but it wasnt outside of the entire function.This question also covered propterties of expressions. 

Question 2: What is name of the outermost function in scale (2, circle(40, "solid", "blue"))

(a) scale          (b) circle            (c) rectangle           (d) contract

The correct answer is A since the scale is out of the function thats in perentheses.
