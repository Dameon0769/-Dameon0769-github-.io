During this week one of the things we did was reviewing code that can become helpful to us later and learning new stuff like booleans. we also got a worksheet we had to work on during the period in class to strengthen my coding skills.

Today we made bar graph and pie graphs for the programs that we created for our data it looks like a graph like stock trades and how much a stock went up during the year, month, and day.

We learned how to be more specific during coding. In order for people to understand us more we can use things like I notice, I think, and I wonder and we are supposed to describe, connect, and extend about the things we are doing so we can make the person that is viewing our page how everything works.
