During this week in Advanced computer science class we have been looking at flags in order to learn to code them onto the computer and to explore the world of code.
Recently i have been struggling trying to find a flag that is easy but at the same time giving me the necessary steps that includes the code which can still keep me up with the class so i wont fall behind early in the school year.
The only challenge i have is finding a way to make a star using code because the only thing i can make right now is a rectangle,square and thats pretty much it but ill be looking up more code in order to make my work more easier in class so i wouldnt be behind everyone and maybe get ahead of some in the class.
