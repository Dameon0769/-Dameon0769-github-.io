## Explain your code.

-   Choose a significant part of your program (15 lines max) and paste it below. Do not insert your entire program here. 

include image 

width = 160
height = 100

RR = rectangle(width,height,"solid","royal-blue")
YL = rectangle(20,height,"solid","gold")
bb = rectangle(width,20,"solid","gold")


-   Explain each argument in the code section. _then delete this instruction_
 
 The width part of the program is represting the number 160 which is the width of the flag and for height it is representing the height of the flag. As for RR,YL,BB they stand for each color that is being presented in this flag. Width and height are together since they are representing the flags height and width.The word "solid" is for the color to stay solid and "royal blue" is the color that the flag has as its flag

-   Tell us how it functions independently and within the whole program _then delete this instruction_
